# GasDiffusionVisualization

The project named 'Gasvisualization' simulates an example of the long range natural gas diffusion. The development platform for the project is Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

The simulated data is shown in Table 3. The spatial extent of the natural gas concentration field is determined by the longitude ranging from 105.5°E to 105.9°E, the latitude ranging from 31.0°N to 31.4°N, and the altitude ranging from 0 m to 2000 m. The leakage source is located at (105.5°E, 31.1°N, 500 m). The total diffusion time is 60 minutes.

The F1 key on the keyboard controls the start and pause of the dynamic visualization of the long range natural gas diffusion, and the F2 key enables dynamic visualization from the diffusion time of 0 minute. Once the total diffusion time is reached, the dynamic visualization of the long range natural gas diffusion will be performed from the beginning.

The experiment is implemented on osgEarth version 2.6 using C ++ and GLSL version 110 and run on a Windows desktop PC with Intel(R) Xeon(R) E3-1240 v6 3.70GHz CPUs, NVDIA Quadro K620 graphics, with 16 GB of RAM and 2 GB of video memory.
